# Changelog

## 0.2.0
In progress

**Added**

* Adopt a path trie data structure for getting routes quickly and without heap memory (i.e. garbage) allocations. A path trie requires k hash lookups where k is the number of "/" separated parts in the path (typically 2-5) and zero allocations.

**Changed**

Warp ServeMux continues to provide http.ServeMux method signatures for drop-in code compatability, but a few routing behaviors are purposefully different. The ported http.ServeMux tests are updated accordingly.

* Stop treating slash terminated patterns as rooted subtrees that match all paths not match by other patterns and having idential prefixes (e.g. previously path /id/unknown matched pattern /id/ and /, preferring the longest). This behavior can be emulated with params if desired.
* Require registered patterns to begin with a "/".

**Removed**

* Drop support for hostname specific pattern matching.
* Map data structure for storing registered patterns and routes, with each comparison requiring iteration over the path and numerous allocations.

## 0.1.0
Commit: 1fee4cbb906de0c3ea99d324680622f787bc384a

**Features**

* Drop-in compatible fork of http.ServeMux; existing method signatures were preserved and all http.ServeMux tests pass
* Patterns can have capture parameters that match parts of the URL
* Patterns can be registered to match specific HTTP verbs (Head, Get, Post, Put, Delete, Options)
* Supports unicode parameter names
* Routes may be registered with additional http.Request matching rules
